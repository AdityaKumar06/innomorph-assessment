# 360° Interactive Car Viewer & Panorama Demo 🚗🖼️✨

**Single-file vanilla JavaScript project** demonstrating multiple interaction patterns for a 360° product viewer (car rotation) + immersive 360° panorama.

Built as a lightweight, framework-free showcase to demonstrate front-end skills: DOM manipulation, event handling (mouse, touch, keyboard, wheel), modular code structure, responsive design, theme switching, and third-party library integration (Pannellum).

**Live demo goal**: One HTML file → open in browser → everything works (assuming image assets are present). 🎯
