# 360° Car Viewer & Panorama Showcase

Simple interactive 360° product viewer (car spin) built with vanilla JavaScript + multiple control modes, plus a Pannellum-powered 360° panorama — created for assessment purposes.

All spin viewers use the same set of 51 high-quality car images (PNG sequence) to create a smooth rotation effect.
